# __chess-xr__

#### __Chess in a VR web environment. December 11, 2020__

#### By _**Emme Buentiempo**_

## Description

This application was created as a capstone project for Epicodus, with the intent to have it serve as a demonstration of knowledge after the program's completion. For the time being this README will serve as a marker for project progress. 

## Project Objectives:

List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:

* Virtual chessboard made of individual assets (board and chess pieces)
* All items are able to be grabbed and moved
* Pieces will snap to board when moved, and will only accept legal moves.

What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.

* WebXR API
* Three.JS
* react-three-fiber
* drei
* react-xr

If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.

* Turn restrictions for pieces (white first, then black)
* Rudimentary AI for opponent moves
* Additional virtual environment for board to exist within (room with table)
* Additional objects in room for interaction (small radio to turn on with sound)

What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?

* Web Audio API
* Possibly A-Frame framework
